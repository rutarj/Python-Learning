Key Learnings
Variable Declaration: I learned how to declare variables in Python and assign values to them. In this project, I used variables to store product names, prices, company details, and a closing message.

String Formatting: Through string formatting techniques, I learned how to create formatted output for displaying information. Specifically, I used string formatting to print the product names and prices in a neat and organized manner.

Printing Output: I gained familiarity with the print() function and its usage to display output on the console. The script utilizes print() statements to print various components of the receipt, including company details, product information, total price, and a closing message.

Basic Arithmetic Operations: This project involved basic arithmetic operations such as addition. I calculated the total price of the items by summing up their individual prices.

Script Organization: I practiced organizing my code into sections with descriptive comments. This helped improve code readability and made it easier to understand the purpose of each segment.
