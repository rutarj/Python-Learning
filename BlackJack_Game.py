# Summary of What You Learned While Coding This Game
# Basic Game Flow: Understanding the structure of a simple game loop, including initializing the game, taking user inputs, and processing game logic until the game ends.
# Card Dealing Mechanism: How to simulate dealing cards from a deck, including the randomness and selection of cards.
# Score Calculation: Implementing a scoring system that handles special rules, such as the value of an Ace being either 1 or 11, and identifying blackjack conditions.
# Conditional Logic: Using conditional statements to manage the game state, check for winning or losing conditions, and handle various scenarios within the game.
# Function Design: Designing and using functions to encapsulate different parts of the game logic, making the code more organized and modular.
# User Interaction: Handling user input to control the flow of the game, including asking whether to draw more cards or to restart the game.
# Game State Management: Managing and updating the game state, including the players' hands and scores, until the game concludes.
# Output and Display: Printing out the current game state to the console, including the players' hands and scores, to provide feedback to the user.
