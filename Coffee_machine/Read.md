Learning Outcomes from the Coffee Machine App
Working on the Coffee Machine app using class objects and other object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts has provided several valuable insights and practical skills. Here are the key takeaways and what you have likely learned:

Class Creation and Object Instantiation:

You learned how to create a class in Python, which is a blueprint for creating objects.
By defining the CoffeeMaker class, you set up a structure for objects that model a coffee machine.
Initialization Method (__init__):

The __init__ method is used to initialize the state of an object. In this case, it initializes the resources (water, milk, coffee) available in the coffee machine.
Attributes and Methods:

You explored how to define attributes (like resources) that hold data for the class.
Methods like report, is_resource_sufficient, and make_coffee define the behaviors of the class. These methods allow the coffee machine to report its resources, check resource sufficiency, and make coffee, respectively.
Encapsulation:

By bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single class, you practiced encapsulation, one of the fundamental principles of OOP. This helps in keeping the internal representation of the object hidden from the outside.
Conditional Logic:

Within the is_resource_sufficient method, you used conditional logic to check if the coffee machine has enough resources to make the desired drink. This involves iterating through the ingredients and comparing them with available resources.
Resource Management:

The make_coffee method demonstrates resource management by deducting the required ingredients from the machine's resources after making a drink. This ensures that the state of the machine is always up-to-date.
